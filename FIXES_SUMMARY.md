# LineLogic App Fixes - Summary Report

## Issues Fixed:

### 1. ✅ Build Error in Credits Page (app/credits/page.tsx)
**Problem**: Syntax error with orphaned JSX elements causing build failure
```jsx
// BEFORE (broken):
<Button>Contact Admin for Credits</Button>
  Purchase Credits
</Button>

// AFTER (fixed):
<Button>Contact Admin for Credits</Button>
```

### 2. ✅ Admin Panel Authentication

**Solution**: Implemented proper authentication system

**Changes Made**:

- Only `henkster91@gmail.com` and `monksb92@gmail.com` can access admin panel
- Users must be logged in to access admin features
- Automatic redirect to login if not authenticated
- Automatic redirect to queue-testing if not admin

### 3. ✅ Credits System - Manual Verification Only
